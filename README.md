I got hands-on experience with IoT systems and frontend web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I improved my skills in using Arduino IDE, ESP32 microcontrollers, and IoT integration by applying them to real-world problems.

A big part of the internship was working on a project called "Smart Hill Road Safety and Traffic Management System." This project combines self-powered Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) sensors with an IoT platform to monitor and manage hill roads in real time.

Some important parts of the project include:
Energy Harvesting Sensors: TENG sensors collect energy from vehicles, making the system sustainable, low-maintenance, and waterproof. They work well even in rain or bad weather.
Real-Time Data Monitoring: The system checks traffic, temperature, humidity, and landslides using ESP32 microcontrollers. All this data is shown on a live dashboard.
Preventive Safety Mechanisms: The system uses lights and alarms to help prevent accidents in dangerous situations.
Suitability for Hilly Areas: The TENG sensors are strong and reliable, making them perfect for tough hill road conditions.
This internship let me combine IoT, energy harvesting, and web development into a new safety solution.
It helps improve road safety and efficiency in hilly areas through real-time data and active safety measures.

How it works:
The Smart Hill Road Safety and Traffic Management System is designed to improve safety and regulate vehicle movement on narrow and dangerous hill roads using TENG (Triboelectric Nanogenerator) sensors and IoT-based technology. In this system, the TENG sensors are placed directly on top of the road surface without cutting or damaging the road, making installation simple and cost-efficient. When a vehicle passes over the TENG strip, the pressure and friction between the tire and sensor generate electrical signals. These signals are sent to a microcontroller such as an ESP32 or Arduino, which interprets them to identify vehicle presence, speed, weight, and movement pattern. By analyzing these values, the system can monitor traffic flow and detect unsafe driving behavior.
This project plays a major role in preventing accidents on blind curves and steep hill sections where visibility is low. When a vehicle is detected approaching a sharp turn, the sensor immediately activates a warning display board located ahead of the curve. This warns incoming vehicles about the presence of another vehicle on the opposite side, thereby reducing the chances of head-on collisions. The system also monitors vehicle speed and triggers a bright warning signal if a vehicle is overspeeding, reminding drivers to slow down. The use of TENG sensors makes the system highly efficient because they generate their own small amount of power from mechanical movement, reducing the need for large electrical systems.
Hill roads often experience fog and poor visibility, making driving more risky. The system responds to this by automatically illuminating LED warning boards whenever a vehicle is detected, allowing drivers to see ahead even in foggy conditions. Along with this, the system continuously counts the number of vehicles passing through the road and sends real-time data to a cloud dashboard using IoT communication. This helps authorities monitor traffic density, manage peak hours, and take action during congestion or emergencies. Additional sensors, such as vibration and soil moisture sensors, can also be integrated to monitor landslide-prone areas. If unusual ground movement is detected, the system can issue alert notifications to prevent vehicles from entering the danger zone.
In case of accidents, the TENG sensor can detect sudden high pressure or abnormal impact from a vehicle, and the microcontroller quickly sends an emergency alert message along with the GPS location to the control center or emergency services. LED sirens or alarm indicators on the roadside can also be activated to warn nearby drivers. Since the system uses low-power components and renewable energy sources such as TENG and optional solar panels, it is suitable for remote hill areas where power supply is limited.
Overall, the Smart Hill Road Safety and Traffic Management System provides a reliable, low-cost, and innovative solution to improve safety on hill roads. By using surface-mounted TENG sensors, the system avoids road damage and ensures easy maintenance. It enhances visibility, reduces accidents on blind curves, controls overspeeding, monitors traffic flow, and supports emergency response. This smart and sustainable approach makes hill transportation safer and more manageable, benefiting both drivers and road authorities.
